## 🔍 If You're Getting Errors Opening PDFs from Downloads

If you're trying to open PDFs from your Downloads folder and getting errors:

1. **Use the PDFs from the project location** - They're already organized and ready to use
2. **The application will automatically find them** - The `pdfMapping.ts` file is configured to use these PDFs
3. **Don't worry about Downloads folder** - Those files may be corrupted or have path issues
